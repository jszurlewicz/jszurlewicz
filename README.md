## 👨‍💼 About Me
Hello! My name is **Juan Ignacio Szurlewicz** and I’m from Argentina. I'm a **young economist, data analyst, and data scientist** with over **2 years of experience** in the data field.

During this time, I've worked as a consultant for a leading consulting firm in Argentina, where I contributed to various **S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning)** and **IBP (Integrated Business Planning)** projects. My work involved delivering valuable solutions to clients in the **retail industry**, primarily in Brazil.

I primarily used **Pyplan**, the proprietary library and IDE developed by the company, which is based on Python. This platform enabled us to develop and deploy complex models tailored to our clients' needs.
