Welcome to My Personal Repository!
I'm excited to share a bit about myself and my journey in the world of data.

I'm a young economist, data analyst, and data scientist with over two years of experience in the data field. During this time, I have worked as a consultant for a leading consulting firm in Argentina, where I had the opportunity to contribute to various S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning) and IBP (Integrated Business Planning) projects. My role involved providing valuable solutions to a diverse range of clients in the retail industry, primarily based in Brazil.

Throughout these projects, I honed my skills in Python, utilizing it as my primary programming language. I applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and leveraged a wide array of public libraries, including pandas, numpy, xarray, scikit-learn, SciPy, PySpark, and many others.

In addition to my expertise in Python, I am proficient in SQL, Power BI, and various Microsoft tools, which I have used extensively in my work.

I am fluent in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, and I have a basic understanding of German.
